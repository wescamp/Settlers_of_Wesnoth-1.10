			text=_"<span color='yellow'>This is the help for Settlers of Wesnoth. It is strongly recommended to read this while and only while it is not your turn. Firstly, you have to do something during your turn wait, and secondly, the other players don't need to wait for you for so long. You can read this help out-of-turn either by selecting the leader units (in the top left of the map) and hovering your mouse cursor over their unit type name which shows up in the right side bar or by opening up the scenario objectives from the menu. The ladder has the disadvantage that it blocks the turn bell so you won't notice if it's your turn again.</span>
<span font-style='italic'>Here is a comprehensive rule set for the Settlers of Wesnoth add-on. Please read this if this is your first time playing.</span>
If you weren't aware, you don't actually have to be 8 to play Settlers of Wesnoth. In fact, the game is much more balanced with only four players. Don't use AIs.
Feel free to report any bugs you may encounter or give any suggestion or comment you may have on the Settlers of Wesnoth development thread in the Multiplayer Development board on the Battle for Wesnoth Forums. This add-on is inspired by the awesome board game Settlers of Catan, was made by Dixie, with special thanks to Silene, Anonymissimus and Crendgrim and is currently maintained by Anonymissimus."

			text=_"<span color='yellow'>I OBJECTIVES</span>
The goal will be set at game start by the first player to take a turn. It will probably be one of  eight (8) for a short game, ten (10) for a medium one, or twelve (12) for a long one. There are five ways to get victory points:
<b>1)</b> Victory development cards, which are worth one point each and are only revealed at the end of the game. Be aware that if you are 4 players or less, there are only 5 of those cards, if you are 5 or 6, there are only 8, and if you are 7 or 8, there are 10. More on development cards later.
<b>2)</b> The Longest road award, which is given to the first player to have a 5 units long road, and to the one to make the longest road thereafter. It is worth two victory points. Be aware that each player has a maximum of 15 road units, so the first player to make a 15 units long road is assured to keep the award.
<b>3)</b> The Largest army award, which is given to the first player to have used 3 knight development cards, and to the one to have used the most afterward. It is also worth two points. Be aware that if you are 4 players or less, there are only 14 knight cards, if you are 5 or 6, there are 21 knight cards, and if you are 7 or 8, there are 28 knight cards. More info on development cards later.
<b>4)</b> Build settlements. Each settlement is worth one victory point. They also allow you to collect more resources to build more stuff, settlements are the base of your economy! Note that you will begin the game with two free settlements: you begin play with two victory points! Be aware that each player has a maximum of 5 settlements. More on these later.
<b>5)</b> Upgrade settlements to cities. Cities are not only worth two victory points, but they also allow you to collect two units of resource instead of just one. Be aware that each player has a maximum of 4 cities, but they do not count towards the maximum amount of settlements. More on these later."

			text=_"<span color='yellow'>II READING THE MAP</span>
The map is generated randomly each game and depends on the number of players. Resources hexes are placed and assorted randomly with numbered tokens (see later). Ports are also distributed randomly amongst specific spots.
Identifying what terrain produces what resource is essential basic information. Dry grass produces grain, green grass produces wool, hills produce brick, mountains produce ore, forests produce lumber and the desert produces nothing. Roads (paved or not) and water are not considered 'hexes' for the purpose of this game, and do not produce anything either. On the standard 4 players map, there are four forests, dry grass and green grass hexes, three hills and mountains ones, and a single desert hex, but this will vary with different maps. The way to produce/harvest resource units is to have its number come up and have a settlement or city next to it. More on this later.
You can see your total amount of resource units at the left of the map, or by accessing either the trade or development right-click context menus anytime during your turn. Don't hoard them, though: having more than seven total resource units could hinder you more than it helps. See the Robber, later, for more information about this."

			text=_"<span color='yellow'>III COLLECTING RESOURCES</span>
Save for the first two turns (see later), each player's turns begin invariably by rolling two six-sided die. The sum indicates what resource hex will produce resources this turn: numbered tokens are conveniently randomly assorted with every resource hex, save for the desert, since it produces nothing. The little dots later the numbers indicate the amount of chances on 36 that a number comes out. While there are a single occurrence of the two (2) and twelve (12) token on the standard 4 players map, every other token will appear twice. This will be different on other maps. It is also impossible for two six (6)s or two eight (8)s to be adjacent to each other. You will also notice that seven, the number that is most likely to be rolled, has no token: rolling a seven activates the robber. Also note that the token that has the robber sitting on it will never produce resource, even if its number is rolled. More on this later.
<span color='yellow'>IV BUILDING AND EXPANDING</span>
Okay, so you are collecting resources. That's all fine and dandy, but how are you to transform these into victory points?
The basic building unit is the road. It is relatively cheap: it only costs a unit of lumber and a unit of brick to make. Some development cards will even let you place free roads (more on them later)! It is especially important at the beginning of the game to expend. Well-placed roads can also be rewarding: the Longest Road award is a considerable boost to your score. Roads can only placed on resource hexes' side segments. That is, the brown, unpaved road tiles. You also can't place them just anywhere: every newly bought road unit must be connected with (adjacent to) a previously placed road segment (not considering the paved hex corners). Be aware that every player has a maximum of fifteen (15) road units. Think about it when placing your roads."
		[/value]

			text=_"After a few roads, the next thing to look for is a settlement. Settlements are an essential part of any nation, because it is through these that one will collect more resources. Each resource hex which has its number rolled will produce a unit of resource per settlement a player has adjacent to it. Settlements' price is much more steep than roads, however, as it demands great diversity: it costs a unit of wool, a unit of grain, a unit of lumber and a unit of brick. The placement of settlements is also restricted to resource hexes' corners, which are the paved road tiles, and must be connected to by roads. Also note that settlements cannot be placed on corners adjacent to other settlements or cities: the nearest settlement or city of any new settlement must be at least two corners (paved road tiles) away. It is also important knowing that building a settlement on a corner adjacent to a port (adjacent to a dock/bridge connecting to one) will claim that port for its player (more on ports later). Be aware that every settlement is worth one (1) victory point and that every player has a maximum of five (5) settlements.
As you might have noticed, the maximum amount of points one can get from building roads and settlements is seven. Enter the cities, which are worth two victory points each. Cities must be built over settlements and have the highest cost of all: two units of grain and three units of ore. They also have an added benefit: each resource hex which has its number rolled will produce not one, but two units of resource per city a player has adjacent to it. This is in addition to any settlement that might also be present. Be aware that every player has a maximum of four (4) cities, but that they do not count toward the maximum amount of settlements one can own.
While this covers all the units one can spend resources on, you can also use your resources to buy development cards. More on them later."

			text=_"A last word about buildings. The first two turns of a new game will be employed to place your first two settlements, and the roads that go along with them. There are a few special rules about these. First, the settlements obviously don't have to be connected to roads, as there are no roads yet. The placement of the second settlement is also especially important, as it will determine the resources you start with: you will have a unit of resource of each resource hex that are adjacent to your second settlement. Building it on the coast is therefore not recommended, as it will make you start the game with only two, if not one, unit(s) of resource. Also note that you cannot connect your first two roads together. Be aware that you place only one settlement and one road per turn (on the first two turns, anyway), and that should someone end his turn before placing the settlement or the road, they would be randomly placed, which is not recommended.
<span color='yellow'>V DEVELOPMENT CARDS</span>
The mysterious development cards, at long last! While relatively cheap (they cost a unit of grain, a unit of ore and a unit of wool), the new player will often feel uncomfortable around them, as there are so many other directly rewarding things to do: building a settlement or city is sure to give you a victory point, a development card less so. But they are useful jokers that one can keep in his hand. Do note that while you can buy as many development cards per turn as you wish, you can only use a single one every turn. Choose it carefully! There are five kind of development cards, and twenty-five (25) cards in total (that is, for 4 or less players; for 5 or 6 players, there are 38, and for 7 or 8, there are 50):
<b>Victory</b> development cards are, simply put, bonus victory points hidden in your hand. They will only be revealed when you have enough points (counting them) at the end of your turn to win the game. Other players might suspect that you have one, since they will see how many total development cards you have, but they can never be sure whether it is a victory point or something else. Be aware that with 4 players or less, there are only five (5) victory development cards available in all, for 5 or 6 players there are 8 and for 7 or 8 there are 10."

			text=_"<b>Knight</b> development cards have the same effect as rolling a seven (7) at the start of a turn: they activate the robber. More on him later. Note that rolling a seven does not prevent you from also using a knight. Using knight also have the side benefit of counting towards the Largest Army award, which is worth two victory points. Be aware that for 4 players or less, there are only fourteen (14) knight development cards available in the game, for 5 or 6 there are 21 and for 7 or 8 there are 28.
<b>Road</b> Building development cards allow you to build two free roads this turn, saving you two units of lumber and two units of brick. Do note that this card doesn't allow you to go beyond your maximum amount of fifteen road units. If you have already topped this amount, this card is lost on you. Also note that if you use this card and fail to place one or both roads before ending your turn, they will be lost. For games containing 4 players or less, there are only two (2) Road Building development cards, while there are 3 for games with 5 or 6 players and 4 for 7 or 8 players.
<b>Monopoly</b> development cards can be pretty useful if you lack a certain resource, especially if you know another player is collecting plenty of it. Using this card allows you to choose a type of resource and take all the units of that type the other players have in their hand. There are only two (2) Monopoly development cards in total for games with 4 players or less. For 5 or 6 players, there are 3, and for 7 or 8, there are 4.
<b>Year of Plenty</b> development cards are very useful when you lack a few units of resource to build something important. Using one will allow you to instantly claim two units of resource from the bank, of the same type or not. There are only two (2) Year of Plenty development cards in the deck if 4 players or less are present. For 5 or 6 players, there are 3, and for 7 or 8, there are 4."

			text=_"<span color='yellow'>VI THE ROBBER</span>
The Robber is a very important strategic element of the game, as it can foil someone's plans in more than one way. It is activated by either rolling a seven or by using a Knight development card (see above). The Robber will always start the game on the desert. Do note that while the robber is active, all other options save for the help and trades menus are disabled. You cannot continue your turn until you have moved the robber, but can use this as a mean of intimidation to do profitable trade deals.
The first property of the robber is to negate the resource production of a resource hex. Another player is getting tons of bricks from a six-numbered hill? Sticking the robber there will prevent him from harvesting anything from it until it is moved elsewhere, even if the hex's number continually comes out.
The second property of the robber, which can be a blessing as well as a curse, is an incentive to spend your resources rather then hoard them. Indeed, when the robber is moved (only if activated by chance, not by a card), every player who have more than seven resource cards will have to choose and discard half of them, rounded down.
Last but not least, the third property of the robber is to steal a unit of resource from a city or settlement adjacent to its new spot on the account of the player who moved him. If you know someone has grain and you need some, moving the robber next to one of his settlement could  result in you stealing a unit of grain! If there are more than one player settled adjacent to the hex you move the robber to, you may choose from which player to steal from.
Finally, be aware that if you somehow activated the robber and fail to move him before ending your turn, it will be moved randomly, and you will not benefit from stealing a resource unit from an adjacent settlement or city. Also note that the Robber HAS to be moved, you can't just put him on the hex it currently is again."

			text=_"<span color='yellow'>VII TRADING</span>
Trade is an essential part of the game, as you will likely not succeed to collect the needed resource diversity to build roads and especially settlements or development cards if you abstain yourself from it. There are two kinds of trade: domestic or overseas.
Domestic trade is trading on the island, i.e. with the other players. This is the part where your social and political skills kick in, and it can make or break your game. The player whose turn it is makes an offer and a demand, and every players are asked one after the other if they accept the deal or not. The first one to accept is the one who gets it. It is of course advised that politics are settled first through the chat to save time.
Of course, it is not always possible to achieve a deal satisfactory to both parties with the other players. Hence the option of trading overseas, i.e. with the bank. Claiming ports is especially important in that regard as they can make you save a great deal of resources. There are two kind of ports: resource specific ports, which are marked with the according resource-icon, allow you to give two units of that resource for any single unit of resource, and non-specific ports, marked with a question mark (?), which allow you to give any three similar units of resource for any single unit. If you do not own any port, you can always give any four similar units of resource for any single one in return, but this is costly."
