description=_"Place your settlements strategically to collect resources and trade with the others to develop your colony and be the most thriving settler from Wesnoth on this newfound island.
NEW: If played without 'Settlers of Wesnoth Era', remote clients do not need to have downloaded this addon. The UI is less comfortable, but the rules are exactly the same and no OOS or other gamestate errors are supposed to occur.
Requires BfW "+{./required_version}+_" or greater."
